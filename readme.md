So, to explain everything, I don’t really know why I’m doing this. I think I need to prove to myself that I can achieve something new and great.

Lately, I’ve been really depressed, and this project will be like my own “Path of Pain.”

I hope I won’t give up on it, and I hope that one day we’ll be able to use this OS.

By the way, you should take a look at <a href="docs/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing.md</a>

The installation tutorial is right there <a href="docs/INSTALL.md">Install.md</a>

Thanks for the stars, thanks for believing in me. I’ll try to do my best.
